# Introduction

This tutorial is divided into three sections

## Building a simple DApp

We'll be creating a simple Quote Owning DApp where a quote will be shown on the screen along with its owner information. Anyone can update the quote stored on the blockchain using his account and everyone will see the changed quote with the new owner information. Simple enough?

## Enable Native Meta Transaction

Now we have a simple DApp with a smart contract and a user interface to interact with the smart contract. In order to enable native meta transactions in this DApp, we need to do some modifications in the smart contract so that we can get rid of `sp.sender` property from our smart contracts.

## Integrate Biconomy to enable meta transactions

Now we have everything setup, last step is Biconomy integration to convert a bad user experience into a magical user experience. You'll see it yourself at the end of tutorial.

Let's get started ðŸš€
