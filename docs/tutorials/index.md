# Quote DApp

This tutorial is a step by step approach of making a simple DApp (Decentralized Application) on `Tezos Blockchain` from scratch creating both smart contract and the client side UI.
Then we'll be enabling native meta transactions in the smart contract and at last enabling gasless transactions in the DApp by integrating Biconomy SDK (Mexa) on client side.
